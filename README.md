# Vow of More (or Less) Time

This mod slightly alters the "Vow of Time", and stops the timer after combat finishes.

This means the timer will now only ever run during combat, allowing you to take your time to pick up rewards, gather resources and enjoy the scenery without the pressure of the timer.

<!-- Optionally offers configuration options to alter the amount of time given by each tier of the vow per region, to either make the vow more or less challenging. -->
<!-- Offers a configuration option to turn off this new timer behaviour, in case you only want to tweak the numbers of the timer, but not how the vow itself works. -->
