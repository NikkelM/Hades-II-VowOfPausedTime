# Vow of Paused Time

Alters the "Vow of Time", pausing its timer outside of combat.

This allows you to take your time after an encounter to pick up rewards, gather resources and enjoy the scenery without the pressure of the timer.

Optionally offers configuration options to alter the amount of time given by each tier of the vow per region, to either make the vow more or less challenging.
By default, each tier gives slightly *less* time than usual to make up for the decreased difficulty of the Vow.

You can also choose to have the mod pause *all* in-game timers outside of combat, instead of only the Vow's timer.
This will pause timers on e.g. Hermes' keepsake, Chaos' curse and also the overall clear timer. 

Pausing the timer outside of combat can be turned off in the config, in case you only want to tweak the raw numbers the vow offers.

*Note: The timer will always run in normal Fields of Mourning combat rooms, and in the town square of Ephyra, if enemies are present.*
